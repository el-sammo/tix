					California Online Privacy Protection Act

					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to 

					post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or 

					company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting 

					personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy 

					policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with 

					whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: 

					http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

					According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

					Users can visit our site anonymously.

					Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum 

					on the first significant page after entering our website.

					Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page 

					specified above.

					Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:

					      • On our Privacy Policy Page

					Users are able to change their personal information:

					How does our site handle do not track signals?

					We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not 

					Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. 

					Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?

					It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking

					COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

					When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's 

					Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, 

					the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what 

					operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

					We do not specifically market to children under 13.

					Fair Information Practices

					The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States 

					and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data 

					protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and 

					how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect 

					personal information.

					In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive 

					action, should a data breach occur:

					We will notify the users via email

					      • Within 7 business days

					We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to 

					pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the 

					law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, 

					but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or 

					prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

					CAN SPAM Act

					The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements 

					for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to 

					them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

					We collect your email address in order to:

					To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:

					If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us 

					at

					and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

					If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the information
